Build / install with

    python setup.py build
        
        or (for the brave)

    python setup.py install

    
 >>> import vixpy

 See example.py for usage.


Notes
- Developed against VIX API 1.12, Python 2.7
- Both 64-bit and 32-bit builds on Windows and Linux should work
- VMWARE_ vars in setup.py should be adjusted appropriately


TODO
- Auto find VIX libs on Windows
- Auto "set" Linux LD_LIBRARY_PATH 


Build Notes

Python 2.6 and 2.7 are built with Visual Studio 2008.  Build these bindings with
the appropriate VS version.  The MSCRT version is what really matters.

Linux Notes

Need to install VIX bundle if VMWare not installed
# sh VMware-VIX-1.10.3-368992.x86_64.bundle -x /some/install/directory

Python needs to be able to find VIX library at run time
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/some/install/directory/vmware-vix/lib python somescript.py
