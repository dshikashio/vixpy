Build / install with

1. python setup.py build
1.a OSX only
`install_name_tool -change libvixAllProducts.dylib "/Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Public/libvixAllProducts.dylib" $(find . -name _vixpy.so)`
2. python setup.py install
    
 >>> import vixpy

 See example.py for usage.

Notes
- Developed against VIX API 1.15, Python 3.5
- Both 64-bit and 32-bit builds on Windows and Linux should work
- VMWARE_ vars in setup.py should be adjusted appropriately


TODO
- Auto find VIX libs on Windows
- Auto "set" Linux LD_LIBRARY_PATH 


Windows Notes

Python 3.5 are built with Visual Studio 2015.  Build these bindings with
the appropriate VS version.  The MSCRT version is what really matters.

Linux Notes

Need to install VIX bundle if VMWare not installed
# sh VMware-VIX-1.12.2-1031769.x86_64.bundle

Python might need to be able to find VIX library at run time depending on
install location
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/some/other/path/vmware-vix python somescript.py

OSX Notes

Necessary Vix files should be located at 
/Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Public
/Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Public/include

Python might need to be able to find VIX library at run time
# DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Public/" python somescript.py
